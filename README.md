## My process

I feel like im getting better at writing CSS and I will continue to get more practice and learn some animations. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to only display one picture at a time when I had 2 different pictures. I got more practice with flex box.


### Continued development

I want tp get more practice using flex box to build layouts. I also liked using a moblie first approach, so I want to keep using that.
